    "    The overall goal is to divide data into distinct groups such that ovservations within each group are similar\n",

    "    <li>> For each cluster, compute the cluster centroid by taking the mean vector of points in the cluster</li>\n",

    "    <li>There is no easy answer for choosing a \"best\" K value</li>\n",
    "    <li>One way is the elbow method</li>\n",
    "    First of all, compute the sum of swared error (SSE) for some values of K (for example 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.).\n",
    "    <br>The SSE is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each member of the cluster and it's centroid.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    If you plot K against the SSE, you will see that the error decreases as k gets larget; this is because when the number of clusters increases, they should be smaller, so distortion is also smaller.\n",
    "    <br>The idea of the elbow method is to choose the K at which the SSE decreases abruptly.\n",
    "    <br>This produces an \"elbow effect\" in the graph\n",
